<br>obviously I am not an expert, so I don't dare saying Skiena is right or wrong.<br>
<br>Accordingly to what he says in his book, given a graph and a value k, it is possible to verify if k is the chromatic number of a graph in expected constant time. Therefore it would mean the problem is in NP.<br>
<br>Perhaps that ""expected"" could make a difference or not, but I believe Skiena is a much more reliable source than myself.<br>
<br><br>
<br>EDIT: on second thought, if the worst case is exponential, that would mean that at least one certificate could not be verified in poly time, which would make the problem not be in NP. And in such case either my interpretation of the book or the book itself is wrong.</p>"	"comment"	"11004731"	"11004305"	"2012-08-08 08:04:28.85856+00"	"0"	""	"11038375"	"100022094"	"2012-08-08 08:09:15.483216+00"	"11007100"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>One minor thing: when you move to take the standard deviation of x, it's still written as x(i) in the equation, which confused me at first. I see now that you were doing the same in your first derivation when taking the mean of the variable. However, there, you remembered to make x the constant which allows you to subtract it from the second factor.</p>
